# Major-Project-Mental-Health-Prediction
Mental health refers to a person's cognitive, behavioral & emotional well-being. It affects everything we do. The way we deal with daily stress in our lives, adapt to changes, handle difficult situations, make decisions, are all dependent on our mental health. Today, around 13% of the world population is suffering from mental illness.  People generally donâ€™t like to share their mental health issues with others due to the stigma regarding mental illness in our society. Some people think it is not something which has to be treated. Eventually the problem rises and becomes out of control. It is essential to recognize the onset of mental illness in a person and provide them with proper treatment before it reaches a critical stage. 

In this project we have analysed the mental health of people belonging to the working-section. We used some machine learning algorithms and built a model which predicts whether or not a person needs to consult a medical professional with respect to his/her mental health status.
